===== 
Title 
===== 
Subtitle 
-------- 
Titles are underlined (or over- 
and underlined) with a printing 
nonalphanumeric 7-bit ASCII 
character. Recommended choices 
are "``= - ` : ' " ~ ^ _ * + # < >``". 
The underline/overline must be at 
least as long as the title text. 

A lone top-level (sub)section 
is lifted up to be the document's 
(sub)title.
